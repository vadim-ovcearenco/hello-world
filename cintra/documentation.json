    "app.py": "Page Title: app.py\n\nModule Overview:\n\n  Purpose: This module sets up a basic Flask web application with two routes: the root route (\"/\") and a \"/ping\" route. It serves as a simple example of how to create and run a Flask application.\n\n  Dependencies: \n  - flask: The Flask library is used to create the web application and define routes.\n\nClasses:\n\n  This module does not define any classes.\n\nFunctions:\n\n  hello_world():\n  - Purpose: Handles requests to the root URL (\"/\") and returns a simple greeting message.\n  - Arguments: None\n  - Returns:\n    - str: The string \"Hello, World!\".\n  - Exceptions: None\n\n  ping():\n  - Purpose: Handles requests to the \"/ping\" URL and returns a simple \"pong\" message, often used for health checks.\n  - Arguments: None\n  - Returns:\n    - str: The string \"pong\".\n  - Exceptions: None\n\nSummary:\nThis file is a basic example of a Flask application. It imports the Flask class from the flask module, creates an instance of the Flask class, and defines two routes: the root route (\"/\") and a \"/ping\" route. The root route returns a \"Hello, World!\" message, while the \"/ping\" route returns a \"pong\" message. This file is useful for understanding the basic structure and setup of a Flask application.",
    "views.py": "Page Title: views.py\n\nModule Overview:\n\n  Purpose: This module is intended to serve as a placeholder for view functions or classes in the application. Views are responsible for handling HTTP requests and returning HTTP responses, typically rendering templates or returning JSON data in web applications.\n\n  Dependencies: \n  - None currently specified, as this is a placeholder file. However, typical dependencies for view modules might include:\n    - `django.shortcuts` for rendering templates and redirecting.\n    - `django.http` for handling HTTP requests and responses.\n    - `django.views` for class-based views.\n\nClasses:\n\n  None currently defined in this placeholder file.\n\nFunctions:\n\n  None currently defined in this placeholder file.\n\nSummary:\nThe `views.py` file is currently a placeholder and does not contain any classes or functions. In a fully developed application, this file would typically include view functions or class-based views that handle various HTTP requests and responses. These views would interact with models to retrieve data, process user input, and render templates or return JSON responses.\n\nFuture developers should add view functions or classes to this file as needed, ensuring to document each addition with the purpose, arguments, return values, and any exceptions that might be raised. Additionally, any dependencies introduced should be listed in the module overview section."
